# Guide on how to use it and what is the structure

1. you can run the `index.html` and from there you can go to `login` or `register`
2. There are 2 Users :
   1. Student:
      - email: `st1@g.com`
      - password: `123123123Aa`
   2. Teacher:
      - email: `t@g.com`
      - password: `123123123Aa`

# Used Techniques

1. Localstorage : used to save all the exams , users , assigned Exams , differnet versions of exams
2. IndexedDB: used it to save the Images as its size is varying and provide what i needed exactly

The logic is basic , it's divided onto `js` folder and `studentData` , `teacherData` and `pages` for html pages

`note: I HATE STYLING!, i used AI to help me in the styling and also used tailwind to make it as easy as possible as this is the most depressing moments for me`
